To run the code one only needs to run either main.cpp or semaphore.cpp. semaphore.cpp is less stable, 
but runs on MacOS. main.cpp has been tested on Ubuntu.
graph.py is an auxiliar code to create graphs once you've successfully ran your cpp chosen file.
Note though that get a graph with several memory sizes they must all have data for the same 
combination of the number of producers and consumers threads.
